## Title: FIFA_23__Goalkeeper_Weakness_Analysis_Dashboard

### Abstract:
This project aims to create an interactive Tableau dashboard to comprehensively evaluate the performance, behavior traits, strengths, and weaknesses of a specific goalkeeper in a gaming context. The dashboard will serve as a powerful tool for gamers, enabling them to optimize their tactical strategies and elevate goal-scoring efficiency.

### Introduction:
In the realm of gaming, goalkeepers play a pivotal role in influencing match outcomes. Understanding the intricacies of a goalkeeper's attributes and characteristics is crucial for players seeking to improve their gameplay. This project endeavors to develop an intuitive Tableau dashboard that delivers valuable insights into goalkeeper performance, behavior traits, and areas of improvement, empowering gamers to refine their tactics and boost goal-scoring prowess.

### Methodology:
1. Data Collection: The dataset was obtained by extracting information from the StatsBomb API, encompassing the most recent and real-time data. In addition, the open-source data repository available at https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data and https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjeetsinghnaik/fifa-23-players-dataset served as a supplementary resource. Subsequently, a thorough data cleaning process was carried out, wherein essential elements were extracted, ensuring the dataset's coherence and relevance. For transparency and reproducibility, the Python Notebook detailing the data cleaning procedures has been provided alongside.

2. Performance Metrics: Key metrics, such as save percentage, goals conceded, clean sheets, and distribution accuracy, will be defined and integrated into the dashboard. These metrics will facilitate a holistic assessment of the goalkeeper's proficiency and impact on gameplay.

3. Behavior Traits Analysis: By analyzing gameplay patterns and decision-making processes, the dashboard will shed light on the goalkeeper's behavioral tendencies. Understanding these traits will help gamers devise effective strategies to exploit vulnerabilities or capitalize on strengths.

4. Visualization: The Tableau dashboard will employ dynamic visualizations, including radar charts, bar graphs, heatmaps, and scatter plots, to present the goalkeeper's attributes and performance data in an interactive manner. This visual representation will enhance user understanding and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

### Results and Impact:
The interactive Tableau dashboard will enable gamers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the specific goalkeeper's performance and behavior. By identifying strengths and weaknesses, players can tailor their tactical approach to capitalize on scoring opportunities. The availability of real-life performance data will bridge the gap between the virtual and real world, enhancing gameplay realism.

To test the results, I conducted two FIFA 23 tournament competitions among our friends and roommates. There was a total of 8 participants in each tournament. The participants were the same in each tournament. A participant played one match against each participant i.e. each participant played 7 games in each tournament. These are the results before and after using the Tableau Dashboard.

 



### Conclusion:
Creating an interactive Tableau dashboard to evaluate goalkeeper performance and behavior traits is poised to revolutionize the gaming experience for players. This project's insights and analysis will empower gamers to optimize their strategies, leading to enhanced goal-scoring efficiency and an enriched gaming journey. By fusing data-driven decision-making with interactive visualizations, the dashboard will undoubtedly elevate the level of tactical sophistication within the gaming community.
